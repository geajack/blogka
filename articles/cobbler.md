## Cobbler

Mix butter (about 115 grams for a typically sized baking dish) and about once to twice the volume of butter in sugar (to taste). Mix it together into a paste. Add flour until the breadcrumb stage (probably about double the volume of butter). Add baking powder, say a generous teaspoonful for a typical baking dish. Add milk until the mixture is spreadable but not pourable, something like the texture of cake frosting. Don't forget to add a pinch of salt.

Butter baking dish and fill with chopped fruit. Dust the fruit with sugar and/or spices beforehand if desired. Spread batter over the top.

Bake at 190 without fan. Check at the 30 minute mark, cover with foil and bake another 45 minutes.

This pastry can be deceptive: a knife may come out clean, and yet the pastry will still taste underdone if stopped there. Go the full 75 minutes.

Tray underneath dish to catch juices is absolutely non-optional.
